### [Introduction](#introduction)

In Kitsu the filters are linked to the **Search bar**. It gives you the opportunity to **save** your search and in a click, get back to it.
 
![Search bar](../img/faq/filter_search_bar.png)

You can find the **Search bar** and the **save** option on different pages : 
* Assets page
* Shots page
* Sequence page

You can find the **Search bar** on a lot of other pages but the main difference will be the lack of the **Save** button next to it ![Search bar](../img/faq/filter_save_button.png).

### [How Search Bar works](#how-search-bar-work)

The search bar uses the autocompletion, so you don't need to type everything to get a result.

For example type the letter V and you already get the result of all the assets starting with a V.

![Search bar autocompletion](../img/faq/filter_autocompletion.png)

You can also search some specific type of asset : Props, Characters, Environment, Fx... The result will display all the assets under this type.

For example lets search all the **FXs**.

Another example is to search a specifique **Sequence** on the **Shots page**. You want to see only the shots of the sequence 1 of the first episode.

If you only type "s001" the result will display all the shots of all the episodes which contain sequence 1.

![Search bar sequence episode](../img/faq/filter_ep_seq.png)

To be more specific on the research you need to detail our search : try e001 s001.

![Search bar sequence 1 episode 1](../img/faq/filter_ep_seq1.png)

As you can see the result is more accurate.

On the same way, you can search specific status links to task. Type the **name of the task** (or the **first letters**), then add the sign **equal** (**=**) and the status you are looking for.

For example, search all the shots which are **Waiting for approval** (**WFA**) at the **Layout** stage. So on the search bar you will type : **lay=wfa**.

![Search layout wfa](../img/faq/filter_lay_wfa.png)

You can continue and be even more specific, you only want to see the first episode. On the search bar add a **space** and type e001. You can be even more specific and just want to see the sequence 2. The research will be **lay=wfa e001 s002**.
