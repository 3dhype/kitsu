# FAQ for Kitsu

## Filters
 
In Kitsu the filters are linked to the **Search bar**. It gives you the opportunity to **save** your search and in a click, get back to it.
 
![Search bar](../img/faq/filter_search_bar.png)

You can find the **Search bar** and the **save** option on different pages : 
* Assets page
* Shots page
* Sequence page

You can find the **Search bar** on a lot of other pages but the main difference will be the lack of the **Save** button next to it ![Search bar](../img/faq/filter_save_button.png).

### How Search Bar works ?

The filters use the autocompletion, so you don't need to type everything to get a result.

For example I type the letter V and I already get the result of all the assets starting with a V.

![Search bar autocompletion](../img/faq/filter_autocompletion.png)

So you can search some specific type of asset : Props, Characters, Environment, Fx. The result will display all the assets under this type.

For example lets search all the **FXs**.

Another example is to search a specifique **Sequence** on the **Shot page**. You need to look at all the shot of the sequence 1 of the first episode.

If you only type "s001" the result will display all the shots of all the episodes which contain sequence 1.

To be more specific on the research we need to detail our search : try e001 s001.

![Search bar sequence 1 episode 1](../img/faq/filter_ep_seq1.png)

As you can see the result is more accurate.

On the same way we can search specific status link to task. You will type the **name of the task** (or the first letter), then add the sign **equal**, **=** and the status you are looking for.

For example we will search all the shots which are **Waiting for approval**, **WFA**. so on the search bar we will type : **lay=wfa**.

![Search layout wfa](../img/faq/filter_lay_wfa.png)

We can continue and be even more specific, we only want to see the first episode. On the search bar add an **space** and add e001, we can be even more specific and just want to see the sequence 2. The research will be **lay=wfa e001 s002**.
