# Admin modules
Admin Modules enables you to customize your own environment of production by defining our own types of tasks, other status or assets and to list actions to be called on Kitsu events.

## Task Type
Task Type corresponds to a step of your production pipelines. All productions currently open in Kitsu are using the same Task Type list.

Default Task Types are already existing, such as **Modeling**, **Set Up** ou **Texture** for Assets, or such as **Layout**, **Animation**, **Rendering**, **Compositing** for Shots. You can delete or modify these default values on clicking either ![Image of Edit](https://kitsu.cg-wire.com/img/CGW_edit.svg) or ![Image of Edit](https://kitsu.cg-wire.com/img/CGW_delete.svg) displayed when you point the line resuming the Task Type.

To create your own Task Type, click on <code class="highlighter-rouge">+ Add Task Type button</code> to display this Dialog Box :
