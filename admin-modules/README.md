# Admin modules
Admin Modules enables you to customize your own environment of production by defining our own types of tasks, other status or assets and to list actions to be called on Kitsu events.

## Task Type
Task Types correspond to the different steps of your production pipeline.
A click on + Add Task Type button, displays this dialog box :
--Name : *string*, the label of your task type;
--Priority : *number*, the range of the column displayed in production web pages;
