# Permissions

Kitsu proposes a simple permission scheme to manage your productions. To set
permissions for a user, go to the employee page and grant him with one of the following role:

## Studio Manager

Admin have read and write access on everything.

## Supervisor

Managers have read and write access on everything production they work on:
assets, shots, tasks, assignations, statistics, breakdown and playlists.

They are not allowed to access the studio team, the main timesheets and the
production list. They can't define task types, task statuses and asset types
neither.

## CG artist

CG artists can only display production of which they are part of.
They can only comment tasks and change their status when they are assigned to 
it.
