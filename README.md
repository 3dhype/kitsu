# Kitsu, CG Production Manager Documentation

Kitsu is a validation tracking app for CG productions. By
offering a clean UI and a shared database, it allows you to communicate
efficiently with all the shareholders of the production: CG Artists,
Production managers, TDs, Supervisors and Clients.

## Getting Started

Depending of your role in the studio we propose you two tutorials:

* [Getting Started as a Production Manager](getting-started-production/README.md#as-a-production-manager): you will learn how to set up a full
  production and dispatch tasks to your team.
* [Getting Started as a CG artist](getting-started-artist/README.md#as-an-artist): you will find all the information required to access
  to your task list, share your progress and upload your results.

Kitsu is written by CG Wire, a company based in France. We help small to
midsize CG studios to manage their production and build pipeline efficiently.

We apply software craftmanship principles as much as possible. We love coding
and consider that strong quality and good developer experience matter a lot.
Our extensive experience allows studios to get better at doing software and
