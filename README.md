# Kitsu, CG Production Manager

Kitsu is a web tool to improve validation tracking in CG productions. By
offering a clean UI and a shared database, it allows you to communicate
efficiently with all the shareholders of the production: graphic designers,
TDs, supervisors and clients.

This application is still a work in progress. To be kept up to date of incoming
releases follow our [blog](https://medium.com/@cgwire).

## Main modules

We already have mockups of the user interfaces. We share them in this section.
Feel free to drop us [an email](mailto:contact@cg-wire.com) to tell us what you
think about it.

We apply software craftmanship principles as much as possible. We love coding
