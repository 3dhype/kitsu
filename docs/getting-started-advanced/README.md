# Getting started as a Production Manager - Advanced Users



## Add Custom columns

To add more information on the general spreadsheet pages, you have to create a 
**Custom column**.


Click on the **+** near the Name column.

![Custom Column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png)

You may have extra information to add on your pages as the **level of difficulties**,
the **name of the studios**, when a production is split, the shot order, etc.

In the custom column, you can store all kinds of text information: a **list of value** or a **free value**.

The **free value** is different for each entity.

The **list of value** gives you the same choice for each entity. Moreover, it has to be filled now. 

![Custom Column list](../img/getting-started/custom_column_list.png)

Type the elements of the list below **Available values**, and confirm them by clicking on **Add value**.

Validate the creation of the custom column with the **Confirm** button.

![Custom Column detail](../img/getting-started/custom_column_detail.png)

Back on the global spreadsheets page, you can fill this information with the edit 
button ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png).

You now see a new line on the edit pop-up. You can select the information from the list, 
alternatively, enter the free values, depending on your previous choice.

Don't forget to press the **Confirm** button when you are done.

![Custom Column detail](../img/getting-started/edit_asset_custom.png)

If you need to **edit** or **delete** the custom column, go back to the general spreadsheet page.
Nearby the name of your custom column, click on the arrow ![Custom Column detail](../img/getting-started/arrow.png). 

You can now **sort** your global page with this new column. For example let's create a **Sort Order** custom column.

![Custom Column exemple](../img/getting-started/custom_column_exemple.png)

then click on the arrox on the right of the column name to open his menu.Then click on **Sort By**

![Custom Column Sort By](../img/getting-started/custom_column_sortby.png)

Now the shots are not sorted by name but by the custom column information.

![Custom Column Sort By result](../img/getting-started/custom_column_sortby_result.png)

You can also select in the menu if you want to edit the name of the custom column and its information, or if you want to delete it.

You can also use the **CSV Import** to fill quickly your custom column.
You need to first create your **Custom Column** into kitsu, then add it in your spreadhseet, then copy paste your data into the **CSV Import**.

## Add multiple Preview

You can add multiple images at the same time, or, once you have uploaded an image, you can add another one.

![attach preview drag drop](../img/getting-started/upload_several_pictures.png)

The **Add preview** pop-up opens and asks you to choose a file.

You can navigate through the pictures uploaded. You need to enlarge the comment section.

![enlarge comment section delete](../img/getting-started/enlarge_comment_delete.png)



## See detail of a shot

If you want to see a detail of a shot, click on its name. 

![Shot detail](../img/getting-started/shot_detail.png)

A new page opens with the list of the tasks, the assignation, and the list
of assets that appear on this shot (**Shot casting**).
 
![Shot detail page](../img/getting-started/shot_detail_page.png)
 
You can click on the status of each task to open the comment panel and see the history of the comments and the different versions.


## Change priorities

At some point on the production you may want to prioritize some tasks, and
pinpoint these urgent tasks to your team.

For this, we use the same technique as before. Click on the space
near a status task (1). 

![Task assigned](../img/getting-started/task_assigned.png)

The action menu appears on the top of the screen. 

![Blue menu](../img/getting-started/blue_menu.png)

Click on the name on the left on the action menu, and choose 
**Change priority**.

![Change priority](../img/getting-started/change_priority.png)

There are four levels of priority: **Normal**, that is the fundamental level of all the
tasks, **High**, **Very High**, or **Emergency**. Save the changes with the
**Confirm** button.

As we have done for the assignation or the status, select the shots (1), select
the level of priority (2), and apply with **Confirm** (3).

![Priority selection](../img/getting-started/priority.png)

You can now see next to the status of the task some **exclamation marks**. The
more there are, the more urgent the task is.  

* (1) is **Normal**, 
* (2) is **High**,
* (3) is **Very High**
* (4) is for **Emergency**.
    
![Priority level](../img/getting-started/priority_level.png)


## Change status per batch

Alternatively, you can do it per **batch**. 

You can select multiple shots or assets, by pressing the **crtl** or
**shift** key.

Then go to the **Change status** section on the action menu.

![action menu status](../img/getting-started/blue_menu_status.png)

Choose the new status for your selected tasks (1). You can also add a comment for all the selected tasks (2)
You validate the new status with the **Confirm** button.

![Change status per batch](../img/getting-started/change_status_batch.png)


## Simplify the global page

You may need to reduce a task type column in a global page. For example, you may be 
only interested in layout and animation but not so much about the shipment for the client.

Close to each task type name, you can click on the arrow 
![Arrow](../img/getting-started/arrow.png) to unfold a submenu. 

You can choose to **Minimize** or **Delete** the task type.

![Tasktype submenu](../img/getting-started/tasktype_minimize.png)

Once the column is minimized, only colored dots show the status.

![Tasktype submenu](../img/getting-started/tasktype_small.png)


You can also hide all the non-essential column, like **Description**, **Custom column**, 
even the minimize columns.

Just click on the **Hide additional information** 
![minimize button](../img/getting-started/minimize.png) button on the top right of the page.

To make the information reappear, click on the same button,
![maximize button](../img/getting-started/maximize.png) it won't have the grey highlight.



## Quotas stat

Kitsu grabs the number of frames (or seconds) validated per day/week/month per Artist.

![Quotat stat page](../img/getting-started/quotas_week.png)

**1**: Select the Task Type

**2**: Select the level of details, Day, Week or Month

**3**: Select the count mode, per Frames or per Seconds.

At any time, you can click on a number and see its detail on the right pannel.
