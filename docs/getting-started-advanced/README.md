At some point on the production you may want to prioritize some tasks, and
pinpoint these urgent tasks to your team.

For this, we use the same technique as before. Click on the space
near a status task (1). 

![Task assigned](../img/getting-started/task_assigned.png)

The action menu appears on the top of the screen. 

![Blue menu](../img/getting-started/blue_menu.png)

tasks, **High**, **Very High**, or **Emergency**. Save the changes with the

the level of priority (2), and apply with **Confirm** (3).

more there are, the more urgent the task is.

only interested in layout and animation but not so much about the shipment for the client.

Close to each task type name, you can click on the arrow 
![Arrow](../img/getting-started/arrow.png) to unfold a submenu. 

You can choose to **Minimize** or **Delete** the task type.
