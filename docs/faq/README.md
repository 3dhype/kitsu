## How to create Filters?

### Introduction to filters

In **Kitsu**, the filters are done through the **search bar**. It allows you to
**save** your search query. Once done you can run your query again with a
simple click.
 
![Search bar](../img/faq/filter_search_bar.png)

You can find the **search bar** and the **save** option ![Search
bar](../img/faq/filter_save_button.png). in the following pages: 

* Assets
* Shots
* Sequences
* Todo-lists

NB: The **search bar** is available too in people episodes list.


### How to use the search bar?

The **search bar** query is applied everytime a new character is typed. You
don't need to type everything to get a prompt result.

For example, in the assets page, type the letter `V` and you wil get the
result of all the assets starting with a `V`.  

![Search bar result](../img/faq/filter_autocompletion.png)

You can also search some specific **type of asset** : `Props`, `Character`,
`Environment`, `Fx` ... The result will display all the assets from this type.

For example, let's search all the **FX** assets. 
	
![Search asset type](../img/faq/filter_asset_type.png)

Another example get **shots page** of a specific **sequence**.
Ex: see only the shots of the first sequence of the first episode.

Select the first episode on the drop down menu, then search `s001`, the result
 will get all the shots of all the episodes from sequence 1.

![Search bar sequence episode](../img/faq/filter_ep_seq.png)

In the same way, you can search **specific status** link to task. Type the
**name of the task** (or the **first letters**), then add the sign **equal**
(`=`) and the **status** you are looking for.

For example, search all the shots which are **Waiting for approval** ![WFA](../img/faq/wfa_icon.png)
at the **layout** stage. So on the search bar you will type : `layout=wfa` or
`lay=wfa`.

![Search layout wfa](../img/faq/filter_lay_wfa.png)

You can be even more specific, lets focus on the first sequence : on the search
bar add a **space** after the previous search and type `s001`. 
The research will be `lay=wfa s001` or `s001 layout=wfa`.

![Search layout wfa seq2](../img/faq/filter_lay_wfa_s002.png)


### How to save filter queries?

Kitsu allows you to save your research. You can save them by pressing tne
**Enter**, or click on the **Save** button 
![Save button](../img/faq/filter_save_button.png).

Now under the **search bar** you can see your saved queries as buttons. 

![Search saved](../img/faq/filter_saved.png)

Everytime you get back to this page, the buttons will be there. It will help
you to run commont queries faster.

### What filters can I create?

You can create **filters** about **entities** :
 
* **Sequences** : `s001`, `s002` etc.
* **Asset Type** : `characters`, `environment`, `fx` etc.

You can also create **filters** about **task status**: always use
**task=status**, you don't have to type all the letter of the task, Kitsu will
understand only the first. But the status has to be fully typed.

* Layout is Work in progress (wip) : `layout=wip` or `lay=wip`
* Concept is waiting for approval (wfa) only for the fx : `concept=wfa fx` or `fx con=wfa`
* On sequence 2 Layout is wip : `s002 lay=wip` or `layout=wip s002`


### How to delete filters?

If you have created a **filter button** by mistake, click on the cross next to
it ![Filter delete](../img/faq/filter_delete.png).

The result of the filter will be display, but not the button anymore. Just
cancel your research by deleting the text or use the cross next to the search
bar ![Search delete](../img/faq/filter_cross_delete.png)

## Where can I see my notifications?

### How notifications work?

The notification symbol is the **Bell** button next to your name, top right of
the screen.  Its color is **grey** 
![Notification off](../img/faq/notification_icon_off.png) when you don't have
any notification, and **green** 
![Notification on](../img/faq/notification_icon_on.png) when you have a new
one.

When you click on the **bell** button, it will open the **notifications** page.

There, you can see all the changes made to the **tasks** you are following or
assigned to you.

![Notification page](../img/faq/notification_page.png)

There is a lot of informations on a notification : 

* (1) the name of the **author**
* (2) the related **entity**
* (3) the related **task**
* (4) the new **status**
* (5) the **attached file**

and (6) the comment.

Each part is a **link** you can use to jump on the information you need. If you
click on the **status**, you will jump to the status page of the entity. So you
can react quickly to this new change.

For example, let's assign Jacques to a new task and ask him to work on it.

![Notification example 01](../img/faq/notification_example01.png)

Jacques receives immediately a notification, the **bell** button change color
![Notification on](../img/faq/notification_icon_on.png) , and he can read the
new comment.

**All the notifications and comments appear in real time**. No need to refresh
to stay up to date.

![Notification example 02](../img/faq/notification_example02.png)

### How to get notified?

As an artist you will receive a notification 
![Notification](../img/faq/notification_icon_on.png) as soon as someone change
the status of one of your task, or post a comment.

You can also choose to follow specifics tasks. Go into the task page you want
to follow: on the **assets** or **shots** pages click onto the status icon.

On the top right side of the page you can see an **eye** button 
![Notification off](../img/faq/notification_off.png), next to the
**delete task** button.

![Follow button](../img/faq/notification_other_task.png)

By default you are following all the tasks you are assigned to, on the task
page the icon will be **open** ![Notification on](../img/faq/notification_on.png). 

If you want to follow another task, just click on the **crossed eye** button
![Notification off](../img/faq/notification_off.png), it will change, not
crossed anymore ![Notification on](../img/faq/notification_on.png) meaning you
are now following this task, and will receive notification about it. 

### How to not be notified anymore?

If you don't want to follow a task anymore, just click on the **eye** button
![Notification on](../img/faq/notification_on.png) on the task page. It 
will be crossed ![Notification off](../img/faq/notification_off.png), meaning
you won't receive notifications anymore.
