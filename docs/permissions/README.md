# Permissions

Kitsu proposes a simple permission scheme to manage your productions. To set
permissions for a user, go to the employee page and grant him with one of the following role (the lowest to the higher permission level, each new level of permission inherit the permission of the previous):


## CG artist

CG artists can only display the production of which they are part of.
They can only comment on tasks, upload media, and change their status when they are assigned to it. They only have access to a limited number of status as the Studio manager defines it.

They can create personal filters on the global page and Task Type page.

The CG Artist has access to all the features of the production, but only for display.



## Supervisor

Supervisor inherit CG Artist permissions.

Supervisors have read and write access to everything production they work on:
assets, shots, tasks, assignations, statistics, breakdown, and playlists.

The supervisor can create assets and shots, per hand, or CSV batch import.

The supervisor can comment on all the tasks, add a task type from the drop-down menu, but can't delete a task type.
